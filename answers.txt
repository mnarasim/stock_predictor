Prophet is specifically for time series data and thus requires less hyper parameter tuning.
   LSTM in general works well for sequential data and 	     time series application is just one use case.

1) LSTM is more suited for advanced datasets so perhaps has a tendency to 
overfit in most situations. This is one reason why ARIMA is preferred than LSTM.

2) Exponential smoothing is a method for forecasting univariate time series data. 
It is based on the principle that a prediction is a weighted linear sum of past 
observations or lags. The Exponential Smoothing time series method works by assigning 
exponentially decreasing weights for past observations. The technique is so called 
because the weight assigned to each demand observation exponentially decreases. 

3) A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which 
the series is observed. Seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the 
data experiences regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year. Any 
predictable fluctuation or pattern that recurs or repeats over a one-year period is 
said to be seasonal.

Stationarity is important because it helps with predictability.

4)If the fluctuations are not of a fixed frequency then they are cyclic, if the frequency 
is unchanging and associated with some aspect of the calendar, then the pattern is seasonal.
Seasonality is predictable, whereas  cyclicality  is not.
